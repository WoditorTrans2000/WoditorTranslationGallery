# Translation Project for WolfRPGEditor  

This repository contains translations for WolfRPGEditor

🇺🇸 en-US | 🇧🇷 pt-BR | 🇵🇹 pt-PT | 🇵🇱 pl-PL | 🇷🇺 ru | 🇰🇷 ko-KR

Other versions have yet to be added.

There is 2 goal of this repository:

- To be a place to archive translations of others translator, even is not complete.

- To translate WolfRPGEditor itself, from the previous or latest versions. (The Editor, not Sample Game)
  - For the translation of the sample game, please check [WoditorDataTranslations](https://github.com/yumunet/WoditorDataTranslations) (Yumu) 

You won't find the program in the repository, only the resource files. But if you want to use the **translated Editor**, then check the [releases](https://github.com/WoditorTrans2000/WoditorTranslationGallery/releases).
